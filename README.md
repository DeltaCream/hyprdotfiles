# dotfigs
Formerly named hyprdotfiles, due to the fact that these are a collection of dotfiles for the Hyprland window manager, I renamed it to dotfigs (short for "dotfile configurations") as a more general term for dotfile configurations that affect various aspects of the system, not just Hyprland, so it could affect GNOME, KDE, any other desktop environment, and even your own terminal configuration.

It uses symlinks to connect default locations of configuration files (ranging from .conf to .toml files) to the location of the repository. This allows for easy updates and synchronization across multiple devices.

Currently, these dotfigs mostly include configurations for Fedora, but in the future, support may be added for other distributions such as Arch Linux or Debian/Ubuntu.
