# dotfigs

This repository uses symlinks to connect default locations of configuration files (ranging from .conf to .toml files) to the location of the repository. This allows for easy updates and synchronization across multiple devices.

Currently, these dotfigs mostly include configurations for Fedora, but in the future, support may be added for other distributions such as Arch Linux or Debian/Ubuntu.

## Why hyprdotfigs?

Formerly named hyprdotfiles, due to the fact that these are a collection of dotfiles for the Hyprland window manager, I renamed it to dotfigs (short for "dotfile configurations") as a more general term for dotfile configurations that affect various aspects of the system, not just Hyprland, so it could affect GNOME, KDE, any other desktop environment, and even your own terminal configuration. Now it's named hyprdotfigs.

Initially, this was just meant to be a Hyprland repository containing dotfiles. Thus, hyprdotfiles. Surprisingly though, "hyprdotfiles" was not that unique of a repository name. Eventually, it changed to "dotfigs", which, though significantly more unique, still had other people who named it that way. Then I thought, "why not the best of both ideas?"

Then came ***hyprdotfigs***.

But beyond the name, this repository bears witness in me attempting to growing and understanding all sorts of software that I use, many of which were left untouched from their base configurations, but with a few others significantly curated for my purposes according to my taste.

I think there lies the true spirit of Linux and open source. The freedom to customize things however you want, the freedom to explore, the grand mix of user customization and developer intention.
