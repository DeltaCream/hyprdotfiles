# Removed Options:
Removed hibernate as an option since I wasn't using it, however here it is for those who need it:

{
  "label": "hibernate",
  "action": "systemctl hibernate",
  "text": "Hibernate",
  "keybind": "h",
  "icon": "/usr/share/wleave/icons/hibernate.svg"
},

The hibernate option is originally placed between lock and logout in layout.json
