Ricing involves a lot of components, which will be broken down one by one to discuss what are my immediate focus areas and what are my strategies for ricing them.

## Hyprland Ecosystem
This is obviously the core part, but there are many moving parts worth noting:
1. hyprcursor - I need to pick a cursor theme and a fallback for X11 cursors.
2. hyprland.conf - mostly keybinds, I pick up new ideas for keybinds as I go, and one theme that I find to be uncommon is my pattern of redundant keybinds. There are commands with multiple keybinds, such as SUPER + SHIFT + L and SUPER + SHIFT + RIGHT. This not only allows for flexibility and convenience, but it also makes sense that a given command can have multiple different keybinds depending on the context. For example, the L key combination is based on Vim bindings, while the RIGHT key combination is based on how arrow keys work.
3. hyprsunset - and sunsetr
4. hyprlock - an underutilized component in my rice, but is still just as important and relevant as my display manager that needs to be configured properly later on.
5. hyprpaper - picking a wallpaper theme, sharing a backend alongside awww for use with tools like waypaper
6. hyprlauncher - launching applications, sharing niches alongside others like rofi, sherlock, and walker
7. hypridle - not much configuring, but still necessary for a complete rice.

## Utilities and Must Haves
1. notification daemon
2. fonts
3. status bar/shells/widget systems - stuff like waybar, ironbar, quickshell and eww
4. wallpapers - hyprpaper, awww, mpvpaper for video backgrounds, waypaper and wallrizz
5. app launchers - hyprlauncher, rofi, sherlock, and walker
6. clipboard manager - clipvault
7. file manager - mostly dolphin, but yazi is a competitive choice as well

## Miscellaneous Stuff
1. logout manager - wleave
2. shell stuff - see [dotfile section below](#dotfile-section)
3. terminal configuration - cava, fastfetch, and starship

## Dotfile Section
This section lists various dotfiles for Hyprland, as well as their standout features which I can integrate to my own dotfiles.

1. Hyprland starter configuration
2. Meant for easy work-related configuration
3. Dotfiles Settings App to easily configure Hyprland and its other components (as seen in https://github.com/mylinuxforwork/dotfiles-settings)
4. Background shown blurry in Rofi (show the background while looking up applications)

### JaKooLit
Source: https://github.com/JaKooLit/Hyprland-Dots
1. Shader integration
2. Cava integration
3. Customization of waybar layout (customize how elements within waybar are organized)
4. Extensive support for support across distributions (Debian, Fedora and Arch)
5. Filipino Pride 🇵🇭

### Omarchy
Source: https://github.com/basecamp/omarchy
1. Highly opinionated set-up
2. Walker integration for app runner

### sudoharun
Source: https://github.com/sudoharun/dotfiles 
1. eww integration
2. clean icon layout

### PewDiePie
Source: https://github.com/pewdiepie-archdaemon/dionysus/tree/dionysus/dotfiles
1. crazy, Pewds actually made a Hyprland dotfile
2. eww integration
3. ASCII art for fastfetch
4. cava integration

## Order Of Priority
1. hyprcursor - start with easy, one-off solutions
2. hypridle - same as above
3. hyprsunset/sunsetr
4. After the above three, now comes the hard part:
  - fonts - this affects the entire system, find out the ones most beautiful, then figure out where is it applied on the system
  - notification daemon - I don't have a notification daemon for the longest time, so I might as well
  - wleave - probably my most-changed config thus far, will lay the foundation for how I rice other components such as hyprlock
  - cava, fastfetch and starship - simple, but surprisingly common and technical
  - hyprlock - probably one of the harder things to rice thus far
  - wallpaper - relatively mature, but stuff got broken due to updates, mostly just involving hyprpaper, awww, waypaper, and/or wallrizz
  - theming - probably the hardest part of ricing: tying it all up together in a cohesive theme, will mostly involve colors, contrast, alongside stuff like images and fonts
5. After the above are established, time for the extras:
  - ASCII art
  - shell scripting for use everywhere - from status bars, widgets, convenience scripts, to even installation/set-up automation
  - status bar/shell, widget systems - widely varying, many broken, ***very*** much subject to change
  - app runner - same as above, it's either feature-complete, or every release has a breaking change
  - OSD if any, such as SwayOSD
  - the dotfile extras: AI systems, dynamic color autogeneration, command previews prior to execution, live preview for apps, ewww components, shaders, layout customizations for status bar (like waybar) and app launcher (like rofi), blur, keybind descriptions
  - selection scripts such as for app launcher and/or status bar layouts, wallpapers, and themes
  - the deep changes: mostly things like sddm/greetd and its variants/plasmaloginshell, and even the bootloader such as GRUB or Limine
  - portability: setting it all up across four major distributions - Debian, Fedora, Arch, and Nix
